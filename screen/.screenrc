# 2024-01-18 cperl: Unset COLORTERM until running a screen version
# that supports it. Some terminal emulators set this as a kludy way to
# let programs know they support true color. E.g. alacritty does this,
# but when you run screen, which doesn't yet support true color in
# it's released version, and then run emacs, emacs sees the variable
# and tries to output using truecolor, but then the colors are all
# messed up because screen doesn't get it.
unsetenv COLORTERM
