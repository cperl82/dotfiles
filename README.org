* Dotfiles
This is my dotfiles repo.

The idea is pretty simple, using gnu ~stow~ to manage the dotfiles, copying some others on the internet who did this before I did.

Instead of running ~stow~ directly, I have a wrapper script called ~stow.sh~ that reads an optional config file, ~stow.local~ that is git ignored.  This allows me to change the set of things I want to stow depending on the environment I'm in.

If there is no local config file, ~stow.sh~ attempts to just stow everything.

Note that I don't currently use the ~--dotfiles~ flag to stow because I started storing my dotfiles like this before that option was a thing. I might convert to it someday, but having the directories full of hidden files doesn't really bother me.
